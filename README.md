# HANEMAN
A simple terminal game for Linux*
(Written in GoLang 1.11.1)

This is my first repo and first project, so i'm open to any advices or suggestions.

GAMEGUIDE:

Move the yellow C by using the arrows and run away from the ghosts (&), unless you have activated the SpecialMode (0*). When it's active you have 10 seconds to eat the ghosts, then it's deactivated and 0* replaced on the table. Game ends when you have eaten every ghost or when they've eaten you.

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
When you launch the executable file (HANEMAN) be sure that it is placed in the same directory of "theme.mp3", "tab" and "title".

*Tested only on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS.

Thanks to nsf https://github.com/nsf for the termbox-go package, it's really useful.
